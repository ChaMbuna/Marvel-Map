MARVEL ORIGINS MAP PROJECT FOR UDACITY
======================================

Goal
----
The goal was to create an application with Knockout.js following an MVVM pattern.
Key requirements were mobile functionality, use of a full screen Google Maps API, use of one other API of choice, prevent app-breaking by proper error handling and use asynchronous retrieval of data.


Choice of second API
--------------------
I wanted to do something different than simply show pizza places in an area. My out-of-the-box thinking while I was brainstorming ideas brought me to the <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/"> Marvel API </a>. I quickly embraced the idea of an app that showed where Marvel heroes and villains are born on a very Marvel-y looking map.
